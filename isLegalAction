fresh new file not always having to follow .c format so that we can relaxingly do this hard function
We're not going to compile this file anyways~
or would having c formatting make it easier to read? 












int isLegalAction (Game g, action a){ //assume paths passed in are NULL terminated
  int Legal = FALSE; //because there will be more illegal moves than legal moves
  
  //Section One - checking about paths where they will lead to

  //Section Two - checking about students to build stuff
  
  //Section Three - Checking about students to buy stuff
  
  //Section Four.1 - Checking about the spot where they want to build - Separate Campus and Arc
  
  //Section Four.2
  
  //write more stuff that you see from the OpenLearning Site, or know from Game rules
  
  return Legal;
}
